            <li>Learn a Few French Phrases:</li>
            <p>While many Parisians speak English, making an effort to speak French, even just a few basic phrases like "bonjour" (hello) and "merci" (thank you), can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and enhancing your interactions with locals.</p>
            <li>Take Time to Relax and Enjoy:</li>
